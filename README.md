# CRYSTALS-Kyber_for_8Bit_AVR
This Repository contains an implementation of CRYSTALS-KYBER and DHKEM for an 8-Bit AVR Microcontroller on an ARDUINO MEGA2560. 
These Algorithms can be compared with each other or an early version of NEWHOPE.

## Sources
The implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber is based on the Reference Implementation (<https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber>) and  Post-quantum crypto library for the ARM Cortex-M4 (<https://github.com/mupq/pqm4>).
The Crypto Library, containing the symmetric Algorithms, and the NewHope Implementation are taken from the Arduino Crypto Library (<https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs>).
Helpful implementations for measuring (CPU-Cycle-Counter, Stack-Count and print) on the Arduino MEGA2560 are taken from Peter Schwabe (https://munacl.cryptojedi.org/curve25519-atmega.shtml)
